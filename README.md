# NotesJwtUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.8.
This is the second iteration of my notes application UI. This is the front-end for my spring boot backend: https://github.com/joe3haha/notesjwt .

This second iteration actually has an authentication mechanism in the form of JWT. A JWT is generated by the spring backend and passed to this application where it is stored in local storage. An interceptor service was utilized to append the appropriate headers to each request made to the stateless backend. 

Routing was handled via angular's own routing mechanism and protected by a service that checks the JWT for expiration. For this particular functionality I used a helper by Auth0 found here: https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt . 

The take-aways from this project vs. the first one are the following: 
1. User specific notes now exist since we are authenticating the users and generating notes based on the authenticated user.
2. Appropriate control over access to routes is now happening because the users are authenticated and I could use a service to guard the routes.
3. The navigation pane changes based on authentication status.
4. Appropriate controls around note manipulation. Since the server is stateless, all information is provided via the JWT and as such only the appropriate user can manipulate their own notes. Basically what I'm saying is the GET / POST / PUT / DELETE request are now checking against the authenticated user. 
5. The UI is now mobile ready thanks to W3.CSS found here: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp . I wanted to focuse on learning angular 4.2 instead of spending time creating custom CSS.

The following instructions will tell you how to run the application. Make sure you have the backend running and a MongoDB instance running. Feel free to contact me for any questions you might have. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
